# InfinityGenomes

Infinity Genomes is a genome analysis platform for real-time prediction of potential outbreaks of microbial taxa of interest.
It is designed for continuous monitoring of NCBI(?) database and screening for the taxa of interest, downloading their reads and integrating it with a previously constructed phylogenetic tree which is perpetually updated using PUmPER (http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/10/1476.long).
