# InfinityGenomes

Infinity Genomes is a genome analysis platform for real-time prediction of potential outbreaks of microbial taxa of interest.
It is designed for continuous monitoring (with what software/script?) of the NCBI database and screening for the taxa of interest, downloading their reads (using what? where to?) and integrating it with a previously constructed phylogenetic tree which is perpetually updated using PUmPER (http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/10/1476.long).

This project is part of the Australian MIcrobial GenOmics Symposium (AMIGOS) Network that gathered for the first time in Sydney, NSW, Australia on 14-16 April 2015. Project collaborating members are:
- Aaron Darling, University of Technology, Sydney (project coordinator)
- Phil Giffard, Menzies School of health research
- Shu Mei Teo, University of Melbourne
- Stephen Watts, University of Melbourne
- Jane Hawkey, University of Melbourne
- Sebastian Duchene, University of Sydney
- Brian Forde, University of Queensland
- Ana Esteves, The University of New South Wales
