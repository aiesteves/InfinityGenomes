# InfinityGenomes

Infinity Genomes is a genome analysis platform for real-time prediction of potential outbreaks of microbial taxa of interest.
It is designed for continuous monitoring and screening of the NCBI database for the taxa of interest, downloading their reads and integrating it with a previously constructed phylogenetic tree which is perpetually updated using PUmPER (http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/10/1476.long).

This project is part of the Australian MIcrobial GenOmics Symposium (AMIGOS) Network that gathered for the first time in Sydney, NSW, Australia on 14-16 April 2015. Project collaborating members are:
- Aaron Darling, University of Technology, Sydney (project coordinator)
- Phil Giffard, Menzies School of health research
- Shu Mei Teo, University of Melbourne
- Stephen Watts, University of Melbourne
- Jane Hawkey, University of Melbourne
- Sebastian Duchene, University of Sydney
- Brian Forde, University of Queensland
- Ana Esteves, The University of New South Wales
